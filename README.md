### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for stopping by.

I'm an Embedded System Developer and Hardware Designer, open source software and hardware enthusiast, interested in it since early age, you can call me CloverGit.

As a hardware engineer, I love high accuracy design and cutting-edge hardware, and strive to design extreme hardware. Additionally, I'm a necromancer of vintage electronics (radio, amplifier, computer, CPU, vacuum tube...) and often keen on some hacking trick of hardware.

I specialize in developing firmware for microcontrollers (STM32 mainly, ARM Cortex-M0, M3, M4 and M7), circuit design and PCB layout, mainly use KiCad for hardware development, CLion (CMake + GCC) for embedded software development. I'm passionate about learning and trying new things that I haven't learned before, communicating and sharing that knowledge with others.

Now I'm studying software engineering and transitioning into a full-stack developer.

- ðŸ”­ Recently, I've been learning something in the field of deep learning and machine vision, so as to develop some applications related to it.

- ðŸ“« You can reach me at my email CloverGit@hotmail.com.

- ðŸ”‘ here's my GPG key: `F633CFF04A3EA3407E1723E2B39037F5D0AC3C9B`

- âš¡ You might want me in your machine for some reason:
